## Data cleaning

 - We've found that instead of having the usual 50 states, Washington DC, and New York City, the data set also contains data for the whole US. We choose to focus on the 52 jurisdictions (including the 50 states, DC, and NYC) at first.

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
drug_overdose = read_csv("./data/VSRR_Provisional_Drug_Overdose_Death_Counts.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

unique(pull(drug_overdose, state))
 
# contains 50 states, Washington DC, whole US, and the City of New York.
```



### Tidy data:
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
state_level = c(state.name[1:8], "District of Columbia", state.name[9:32],"New York City", state.name[33:50])
drug_overdose_52 = 
  drug_overdose %>% 
  filter(!(state_name %in% c("United States"))) %>% 
  relocate(state_name) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.name), # change month and year to factor
         year = factor(year),
         state_name = factor(state_name, levels = state_level)) %>% 
  arrange(state_name) %>% 
  group_by(state_name, year) %>% 
  mutate(month = sort(month)) # sort by month order
```

 - Since the dataset mostly doesn't have the death count values for specific types of drug overdose, for this dataset, we only choose the data_value with indicator of `Number of Deaths`, `Percent with drugs specified`, and `Number of Drug Overdose Deaths`.
 
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
drug_overdose_death = 
  drug_overdose_52 %>% 
  select(-c( footnote_symbol, percent_complete, period, percent_pending_investigation, predicted_value)) %>% 
  filter(indicator %in% c("Number of Deaths", "Percent with drugs specified", "Number of Drug Overdose Deaths"))
```
  - `Number of Drug Overdose Deaths` is predicted since the `Percent with drugs specified` is not 100%. 
  
  
### Footnote Categorization: 
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#unique(pull(drug_overdose_51, footnote))
drug_overdose_52 = 
  drug_overdose_52 %>%
  mutate(low_data_quality = ifelse(str_detect(footnote, "low data quality"), 1, 0), # data_value not shown, predicted yes?
         suppressed = ifelse(str_detect(footnote, "suppressed"), 1, 0),
         underreported = ifelse(str_detect(footnote, "Underreported"), 1, 0)) %>% 
  relocate(footnote, .after = last_col())
```
  

## Analysis by drug 
 - In order to analyze the number of deaths in each state and the trend with time according to the type of drug, we only keep the data with the drug label(T4...) in the indicator column in the table. And the we found that there are 9 states missing the specific each drug type deaths counts data: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania.
 - This is a graph based on the drug type. It can be seen from the figure that the number of deaths caused by overdose of opioids has been ranked first during 2015-2021. However, the deaths of methadone have been in a slow-down trend. 

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
drug_categories = 
  drug_overdose_52 %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(-c(state, footnote_symbol, percent_complete, period, percent_pending_investigation, footnote, predicted_value)) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(indicator, "T4"))
knitr::kable(drug_categories[1:3,])


# missing states' data:
miss_states = 
  drug_overdose_52 %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(state_name) %>%
  unique() %>% 
  filter(!(state_name %in% drug_categories$state_name))
knitr::kable(miss_states)

drug_type_plot = 
  drug_overdose %>% 
  filter(state %in% c("US")) %>% 
  filter(!(indicator %in% c("Number of Deaths", "Number of Drug Overdose Deaths", "Percent with drugs specified")))%>% 
  relocate(state) %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.name), # change month and year to factor
         year = factor(year)) %>% 
  arrange(state) %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  mutate(month = sort(month)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = data_value,color = indicator)) +
  geom_point()+
  scale_x_discrete(labels = month.abb)+
  facet_grid(~year)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

drug_gplt = plotly_build(drug_type_plot) %>% 
  layout(legend = list(orientation = "h"))
name_change = c("T40.5", "T40.1", "T40.3", "T40.2","T40.2, T40.3", 
                "T40.2-T40.4", "T40.0-T40.4,T40.6","T43.6", "T40.4")
name_index = c(1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57)
for (i in name_index){
  drug_gplt$x$data[[i]]$name = name_change[which(name_index == i)]

## Trend of drug overdoes deaths rate:
2015 vs. 2021
The plot shows the trend of drug overdoes deaths rate in 2015 and 2021
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sum_df = 
  drug_overdose_death %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(indicator %in%  c("Number of Deaths", "Number of Drug Overdose Deaths")) %>% 
  select(state_name, year, month, indicator, deaths = data_value) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = indicator,
    values_from = deaths
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
plot_df = sum_df %>% 
  group_by(state_name, year, month) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(state_name, year) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_total_deaths = sum(number_of_deaths),
            number_of_total_drug_deaths = sum(number_of_drug_overdose_deaths)) %>% 
  mutate(percent_overdose_death = number_of_total_drug_deaths / number_of_total_deaths) %>% 
  filter(year == c(2015, 2020)) %>% 
  ungroup()

p = ggplot(data = plot_df, aes(x = percent_overdose_death, y=reorder(state_name, percent_overdose_death)))+
  geom_line(aes(group = state_name), alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_point(aes(color = year), alpha = 0.6, size = 4)
ggplotly(p)
```

## By year/month: 

### Which states have highest death in each year
 - In 2015, top three high deaths state are: California, Ohio, Texas <br>
 - In 2016, top three high deaths state are: Florida, Pennsylvania, California <br>
 - In 2017, top three high deaths state are: Ohio, California, Florida <br>
 - In 2018, top three high deaths state are: Florida, Pennsylvania, California <br>
 - In 2019, top three high deaths state are: Florida, Pennsylvania, California <br>
 - In 2020, top three high deaths state are: California, Ohio, Florida  <br>

 Because our dataset is provisional, the data for 2021 is not yet complete. From the figure, we can see that the data for some states are missing, so we will not analyze it here.
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
overview_year = 
  drug_overdose %>% 
  filter(indicator == c("Number of Deaths", "Number of Drug Overdose Deaths")) %>% 
  select("state", "year", "month", "indicator", "data_value") %>% 
  filter(!(state == "US")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(indicator, "Drug Overdose Deaths")) %>% 
  group_by(state, year, indicator) %>% 
  summarize(data_value = sum(data_value)) 
 
  
overview_year_plot = 
  overview_year %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value, color = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()+
  theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
ggplotly(overview_year_plot)
```
